# LTEE2022
This repository comprises two folders, each containing the data and scripts utilized in investigating the change in fitness effects within populations Ara+2 and Ara-1 from the Long-Term Evolution Experiment (LTEE). Folder Ara+2 contains the files corresponding to the results presented in the main text, and it also includes files corresponding to an additional replicate done using the UMI-Seq approach (shown in the SI file). Folder Ara-1 corresponds to results also shown in the SI file. All files follow the same arrangement, with four subfolders containing data and files for raw data processing, fitness estimation, DFE analyses and predictability analyses. Each subfolder includes a README file with specific details guiding the user through the content and purpose of that particular section.
