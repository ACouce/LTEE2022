This set of scripts takes the data files with the fitness effects estimated in folder "2. Fitness estimation" (e.g., "Rfitted_log.txt") and analyzes different aspects of the change in fitness along adaptation. These include the search for general patterns in the shape of the DFE, the prevalence and types of epistasis, and the determinants of the observed frequency of beneficial mutations in the LTEE (in particular, fitness and mutational target size). From the user's point of view, all analyses can be performed via execution of the single master script "main.R".
