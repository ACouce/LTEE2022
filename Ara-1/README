This set of four subfolders contains the data and scripts used to study fitness effects in population Ara-1 from the Long-Term Evolution Experiment (LTEE). The first subfolder, "Raw Data Processing," contains scripts for processing the raw .fastq data, including tasks such as mapping transposons to genomic insertion sites, removing low-quality cases, and quantifying the abundance of each insertion allele. Please note that the original raw files can be accessed on the NCBI BioProject database (PRJNA979973). The second subfolder, "Fitness Estimation," utilizes the insertion abundances across time points generated in the previous subfolder to produce fitness estimates at the sub-genic region level, with the real data files provided for testing the pipeline. The third subfolder, "DFE Analyses," takes the fitness estimates generated in the previous subfolder to analyze aspects of their change along adaptation, covering general patterns in DFE shape changes, prevalence and types of epistasis, and determinants of the observed frequency of beneficial mutations in LTEE. Finally, the subfolder "Predictability," tests the capacity of the estimated DFEs to predict major drivers of adaptation over time in LTEE.
