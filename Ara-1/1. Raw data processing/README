This set of scripts resolves insertion sites from Illumina's raw sequencing reads, and produces a single file with insertion abundances accross time points. From the point of view of the user, these tasks are accomplished in three steps. First, insertion mapping is done by executing the pipeline "main_miseq.sh"; a bash script that handles several Python scripts, calls the BWA algorithm to map reads and filters and merges some of the intermediate files. Second, the compilation of the insertion abundance accross time points is done by executing a single R script ("table.R"). Finally, to mitigate the substantial coverage inequalities accross insertion datasets, a normalization step is carried out by executing the R script ("normalizer.R"). The folder contains two example raw sequencing files ("R0_R1.fastq" and "R0_R2.fastq") to illustrate the functioning of the pipeline "main_miseq.sh", as well as the final tables used in the analyses to illustrate the functioning of "normalizer.R". All the original raw files can be downloaded from the NCBI BioProject database (PRJNA979973).
