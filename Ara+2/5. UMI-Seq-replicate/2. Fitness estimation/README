This set of scripts takes the data files with insertion abundances accross time points, obtained from folder "1. Raw data processing", and produces fitness estimates at the level of sub-genic regions. The pipeline can be run by executing "main.R", an R script that loops through the input files and calls other R scripts that pool alleles into sub-genic regions, prepare working objects, normalize all data against the behaviour of a set of reference neutral loci and estimate fitness by fitting a linear regression model to the normalized frequency trajectories. The folder contains as an example the three data files with the actual insertion abundances used in the manuscript ("Rtable_updated(fuzz).txt, "Ap2_2Ktable_updated(fuzz).txt", "Ap2_15Ktable_updated(fuzz).txt"), so that the user can test the functioning of the whole pipeline.
