This set of scripts resolves insertion sites from Illumina's raw sequencing reads, and produces a single file with insertion abundances accross time points. From the point of view of the user, these tasks are accomplished in three steps. First, insertion mapping is done by executing the pipeline "main_umiseq.sh"; a bash script that handles several Python scripts, calls the BWA algorithm to map reads and filters and merges some of the intermediate files. Second, script "countperallele.R" leverages on the presence of unique molecular identifiers (UMIs) to generate lists of unique, UMI-corrected alleles. Finally, the compilation of the insertion abundance accross time points is done by executing a single R script ("new_table.R"). The folder contains two example raw sequencing files ("ara2-2K_A_J1_R1.fastq" and "ara2-2K_A_J1_R2.fastq") to illustrate the functioning of the pipeline. All the original raw files can be downloaded from the NCBI BioProject database (PRJNA979973).
