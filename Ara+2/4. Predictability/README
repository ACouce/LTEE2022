This set of scripts takes the DFEs estimated in folder "3. DFE analyses" (e.g., "Rtoanal.dat") and assesses the capabilities of these DFEs to capture the major drivers of adaptation identified in metagenomic data. From the user's point of view, all analyses can be performed via execution of the master script "main.R". The actual data files used to produce the results presented in the main text are included here ("Rtoanal.dat", "Ttoanal.dat", "Ftoanal.dat"; refering to the ancestor, 2K and 15K data, respectively).
